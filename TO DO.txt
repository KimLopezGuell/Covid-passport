TO DO UK PAPER:

1. Bootstrapping errors SR (o robustos)
2. Nicer plots with CI, gray lag, etc (see LPH)
3. DID plots superposed
4. Think how many plots and tables
5. Write methods, results, discussion with plots (LPH style)
6. Write abstract (also for conferences?)
7. Write introduction and stuff


NEXT:

1. Do the same for Denmark? Maybe another paper?


DISSERTATION:

1. Maybe finish SR for deaths (UK, Catalonia...)
2. Maybe finish vaccines
3. Do ARIMA for all the countries and outcomes
4. If I don't do the previous, justify why not
5. Extend with Bayesian means, new interventions or other?

6. Write: mathematical methods, data quality, etc. Really talk to Jotun and know what they want and what is liked in a Dissertation
